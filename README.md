No of Cells: 14876

dfxtp_2 = 1613

Flop ratio = 10.8429

 
 
# DAY 2
Width & Height of the Core and Die

Utilization factor = Area of Netlist / Area of Core

Utilization factor less than 1 means there is more space left to add other required items

Aspect Ratio = Height of Core/Width of Core

Aspect ratio not equal to 1 means it is a rectangular chip, else it is square.

Pre placed cells

Big circuits with large number of gates (50000 gates etc) are divided in to blocks. Arrangement of IPs in chip is floor planning. These are placed first in the chip and called preplaced. Example - memory, clockgating etc. They can be re-used like functions.

Decoupling capacitor

Noise margin determines what range of voltage is treated as 1 or 0 (example - 4.5 to 5 V can be 1 and 0 to 0.5 v can be 0). Decoupling capacitor is placed all around the blocks and can act like a local power source very close to block, so reduces problem of voltage loss.
